## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Sync Data

```bash
npm run pinecone:sync
```

This will:
- ✅ Fetch last 7 days (daily data)
- ✅ Fetch last 30 days (daily data + summary)
- ✅ Fetch last 60 days (summary)
- ✅ Fetch last 90 days (summary)
- ✅ Store everything in Pinecone

**Time:** ~1-2 minutes per user

### 2. Test It

```bash
# Test period question
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat/enhanced/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is my ROAS in last 60 days?"}'

# Test daily question
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat/enhanced/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What was my revenue on October 15?"}'
```

### 3. Done!

Your AI now answers everything! 🎉

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm run pinecone:sync`
- [ ] Test: "What is my ROAS in last 30 days?"
- [ ] Test: "What is my ROAS in last 60 days?"
- [ ] Test: "What is my ROAS in last 90 days?"
- [ ] Test: "Compare 30 vs 60 vs 90 days"
- [ ] Test: "What was my revenue on October 15?"
- [ ] Test: "Show me last week day by day"
- [ ] Test: "What was my profit yesterday?"
- [ ] Verify auto-sync on chat init
- [ ] Check Pinecone dashboard for vectors

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Run sync daily** - Keep data fresh
2. **Monitor API calls** - Daily fetching uses more calls
3. **Cache results** - Speed up frequent queries
4. **Test edge cases** - Try different date formats
5. **Check logs** - Monitor sync success

### Optimization

```javascript
// Reduce daily data period if needed
if (period.days <= 7) { // Only last 7 days
  // Fetch daily data
}

// Increase delay to avoid rate limits
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
```

---

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### Example: Chat Component

```jsx
const sendMessage = async (message) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/chat/enhanced/message', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.reply;
};

// Usage
const answer = await sendMessage("What is my ROAS in last 60 days?");
// "Your ROAS for the last 60 days is 7.65x..."
```
