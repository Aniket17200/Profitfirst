# 📊 Detailed Data Storage in Pinecone

## Overview

Store **day-by-day data** in Pinecone so AI can answer ANY question with precision.

---

## 🎯 Data Structure

### Option 1: Period Summaries (Current Implementation)

```javascript
// Stores aggregated data for each period
{
  period: "Last 30 Days",
  totalRevenue: 478863,
  totalOrders: 2918,
  totalROAS: 7.78,
  // ... more metrics
}

{
  period: "Last 60 Days",
  totalRevenue: 957726,
  totalOrders: 5836,
  totalROAS: 7.65,
  // ... more metrics
}
```

**Pros:** Fast, efficient, less storage
**Cons:** Can't answer "What was ROAS on Oct 10?"

### Option 2: Daily Data (Enhanced)

```javascript
// Stores data for EACH day
{
  date: "2024-10-15",
  revenue: 15000,
  orders: 50,
  roas: 7.8,
  adSpend: 1923,
  grossProfit: 9000,
  netProfit: 6000,
  // ... more metrics
}

{
  date: "2024-10-14",
  revenue: 16200,
  orders: 52,
  roas: 7.9,
  // ... more metrics
}
```

**Pros:** Can answer ANY date-specific question
**Cons:** More storage (365 records per user per year)

## 🚀 Implementation: Daily Data Storage

### Step 1: Update Sync Script

Modify `scripts/syncAllDataToPinecone.js`:

```javascript
// Instead of just summary, create daily breakdown
const dailyData = [];

// Get data for each day
for (let i = 0; i < period.days; i++) {
  const date = format(subDays(new Date(), i), 'yyyy-MM-dd');
  
  // Fetch data for this specific day
  const dayData = await dataAggregator.aggregateAllData(
    user,
    date,
    date
  );
  
  if (dayData.orders > 0) {
    dailyData.push({
      date,
      revenue: dayData.revenue,
      orders: dayData.orders,
      roas: dayData.roas,
      adSpend: dayData.adSpend,
      grossProfit: dayData.grossProfit,
      netProfit: dayData.netProfit,
      aov: dayData.aov,
      cogs: dayData.cogs,
      shippingCost: dayData.shippingCost,
      shipments: dayData.totalShipments,
      delivered: dayData.delivered,
      rto: dayData.rto,
    });
  }
}

// Store both daily data AND summary
await pineconeDataSync.storeDailyData(userId, dailyData, summary);
```

### Step 2: Query by Date

```javascript
// In enhancedAI.js
if (query.includes('on October 15') || query.includes('Oct 15')) {
  const results = await pineconeDataSync.queryData(
    userId,
    'data for 2024-10-15',
    5
  );
  
  // Filter for exact date
  const dayData = results.find(r => r.metadata.date === '2024-10-15');
}
```

## 🎯 Questions AI Can Answer

### With Period Summaries (Current)
✅ "What is my ROAS in last 30 days?" → 7.78x
✅ "What is my ROAS in last 60 days?" → 7.65x
✅ "Compare 30 vs 60 vs 90 days" → Shows all three
✅ "What's my revenue this month?" → ₹4,78,863

### With Daily Data (Enhanced)
✅ All above questions PLUS:
✅ "What was my ROAS on October 15?" → 7.8x
✅ "Show me revenue for last week day by day"
✅ "Which day had the highest orders?"
✅ "Compare Monday vs Friday performance"
✅ "What was profit on Oct 10 vs Oct 11?"

## 💾 Storage Calculation

### Period Summaries Only
- 4 periods per user (7, 30, 60, 90 days)
- 1 vector per period = 4 vectors
- 1000 users = 4,000 vectors
- **Cost:** Free tier (100K vectors)

### Daily Data
- 365 days per user
- 1 vector per day = 365 vectors
- 1000 users = 365,000 vectors
- **Cost:** Paid tier needed ($70/month for 5M vectors)

### Hybrid (Recommended)
- Last 30 days: Daily data (30 vectors)
- 31-90 days: Weekly summaries (9 vectors)
- 91+ days: Monthly summaries (12 vectors)
- Total per user: ~51 vectors
- 1000 users = 51,000 vectors
- **Cost:** Free tier!

## 🔧 Implementation Guide

### Quick Implementation (Period Summaries)

**Already done!** Just run:
```bash
npm run pinecone:sync
```

This stores 30, 60, 90-day summaries.

### Enhanced Implementation (Daily Data)

1. **Update sync to fetch daily data:**

```javascript
// In autoSyncPinecone.js
const dailyData = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) { // Last 30 days
  const date = format(subDays(new Date(), i), 'yyyy-MM-dd');
  
  const dayData = await dataAggregator.aggregateAllData(
    user,
    date,
    date
  );
  
  if (dayData.orders > 0) {
    dailyData.push({
      date,
      revenue: dayData.revenue,
      orders: dayData.orders,
      roas: dayData.roas,
      // ... all metrics
    });
  }
}

// Store daily + summary
await pineconeDataSync.storeDailyData(userId, dailyData, summary);
```

2. **Update AI to use daily data:**

```javascript
// In enhancedAI.js
if (queryAnalysis.specificDate) {
  // Find exact date
  const dayData = results.find(r => 
    r.metadata.date === queryAnalysis.specificDate
  );
  
  if (dayData) {
    context += `\nData for ${queryAnalysis.specificDate}:\n`;
    context += `Revenue: ₹${dayData.metadata.revenue}\n`;
    context += `ROAS: ${dayData.metadata.roas}x\n`;
  }
}
```
