# ⚡ Quick Fix: "I Don't Have Data" Issue

## Problem
AI says: "Unfortunately, I don't have data for the last 60 or 90 days"

## Solution (2 Commands)

### 1. Sync All Data
```bash
npm run pinecone:sync
```
Wait 2-5 minutes for completion.

### 2. Test It
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat/enhanced/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Compare my ROAS for last 30, 60, and 90 days"}'
```

## Expected Result
```json
{
  "reply": "Your ROAS performance: Last 30 days: 7.78x, Last 60 days: 7.65x, Last 90 days: 7.52x. Your ad efficiency is consistently strong across all periods."
}
```

## Verify It Works

Test these questions:

- ✅ "Compare last 30 vs 90 days"
- ✅ "Show me quarterly performance"
- ✅ "What was revenue 2 months ago?"

All should work perfectly!
