⚠️ IMPORTANT: YOU MUST RESTART THE SERVER ⚠️

The code has been fixed, but your server is still running the OLD code.

STEPS TO FIX:

1. Go to the terminal where the server is running
2. Press: Ctrl + C (to stop the server)
3. Run: node index.js (to start it again)
4. Wait for: "Server listening at http://localhost:3000"
5. In ANOTHER terminal, run: node test-ai-market-questions.js

WHY?
Node.js loads code into memory when it starts. Changes to files
don't take effect until you restart the server.

QUICK FIX:
Terminal 1: Ctrl+C, then: node index.js
Terminal 2: node test-ai-market-questions.js
