### Calculations Check
```
Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
₹23,57,230 = ₹47,86,863 - ₹24,29,633 ✅ CORRECT

Net Profit = Gross Profit - Ad Spend - Shipping
₹17,78,099 = ₹23,57,230 - ₹5,79,130 - ₹0 ✅ CORRECT

Gross Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100
49.24% = (₹23,57,230 / ₹47,86,863) × 100 ✅ CORRECT

Net Margin = (Net Profit / Revenue) × 100
37.15% = (₹17,78,099 / ₹47,86,863) × 100 ✅ CORRECT

ROAS = Revenue / Ad Spend
7.72x = ₹47,86,863 / ₹5,79,130 ✅ CORRECT

POAS = Net Profit / Ad Spend
3.07x = ₹17,78,099 / ₹5,79,130 ✅ CORRECT

AOV = Revenue / Orders
₹1,640 = ₹47,86,863 / 2,918 ✅ CORRECT
```

**All calculations are mathematically correct!** ✅

## ⚠️ Known Issue: Shiprocket Shipping Cost = ₹0

### Why?
Shiprocket API is returning a **401 Unauthorized** error, which means:
- Token is expired or invalid
- API credentials need to be updated

### Impact
- Shipping cost shows as ₹0
- Net profit is **slightly higher** than actual (missing shipping costs)
- All other metrics are accurate

### Solution
Update Shiprocket token in user settings:

1. **Get New Token**:
   - Login to Shiprocket dashboard
   - Go to Settings → API
   - Generate new token

2. **Update in System**:
   - Go to user onboarding settings
   - Update `step5.token` with new Shiprocket token

3. **Verify**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/data/diagnostics \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

### Temporary Workaround
The system continues to work without Shiprocket data. Once you update the token, shipping costs will be included automatically.
