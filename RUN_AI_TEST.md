## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Running
```
❌ ERROR: Server not running (ECONNREFUSED)
```
**Solution:** Start the server first with `node index.js`

### OpenAI API Error
```
❌ ERROR: OpenAI API error
```
**Solution:** Check `.env` file has valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Timeout
```
❌ ERROR: timeout of 30000ms exceeded
```
**Solution:** 
- Check internet connection
- Verify OpenAI API is accessible
- Increase timeout in test file

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `controller/chatTest.js` - New test endpoint
2. ✅ `routes/profitroute.js` - Added test route
3. ✅ `services/aiOrchestrator.js` - Improved AI prompts
4. ✅ `test-ai-market-questions.js` - Updated endpoint

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run the test suite
2. ✅ Verify all tests pass
3. ✅ Test with real user data via `/api/data/ai/chat` (requires auth)
4. ✅ Monitor AI responses in production
5. ✅ Collect user feedback

## Interactive Testing

For manual testing, use:
```bash
node test-ai-interactive.js
```

Then ask questions like:
- "What is my current revenue?"
- "Predict next month's profit"
- "Compare this month vs last month"

## Production Usage

For production with real user data:
- Use `/api/data/ai/init` to initialize
- Use `/api/data/ai/chat` to send messages
- Requires authentication token
- Uses real business data from user's account

The test endpoint (`/api/data/ai/test`) is for testing only and uses demo data.
