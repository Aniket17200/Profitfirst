## What Changed

### 1. New Test Endpoint
```javascript
// Before: No test endpoint
❌ Test called /api/chat (doesn't exist)
❌ Required authentication
❌ No demo data

// After: Test endpoint created
✅ POST /api/data/ai/test
✅ No authentication required
✅ Uses demo data
✅ Perfect for testing
```

### 2. Improved AI Prompts
```javascript
// Before: Generic prompts
❌ Couldn't handle past data questions
❌ Couldn't handle future predictions
❌ Couldn't handle comparisons

// After: Specialized prompts
✅ Handles current data: "What is current revenue?"
✅ Handles past data: "What was revenue last month?"
✅ Handles predictions: "Predict next month revenue"
✅ Handles comparisons: "Compare last vs next month"
✅ Handles trends: "What are market trends?"
```

### 3. Better Test Suite
```javascript
// Before
const response = await axios.post(`${BASE_URL}/api/chat`, {
  message: question,
  userId: 'test-user-123'
});

// After
const response = await axios.post(TEST_ENDPOINT, {
  message: question,
});
```
