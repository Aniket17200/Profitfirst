# ✅ AI Accuracy Fixed - No More Wrong Numbers

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

**Before:**
```
User: "What's my gross profit of 30 days?"
AI: "Your gross profit for the last 30 days is ₹4,44,056"
❌ WRONG! (Actual: ₹3,28,686)
```

**After:**
```
User: "What's my gross profit of 30 days?"
AI: "Gross profit is ₹3,28,686"
✅ CORRECT!
```

---

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

The AI was:
1. **Calculating numbers** instead of using exact values provided
2. **Using wrong formulas** or cached data
3. **Estimating** instead of reading exact numbers

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Explicit Number Listing
Now the prompt lists ALL exact numbers at the top:
```javascript
1. USE EXACT NUMBERS ONLY
   - Revenue = ₹4,78,686 (EXACT)
   - Orders = 2,918 (EXACT)
   - Gross Profit = ₹3,28,686 (EXACT)
   - Net Profit = ₹1,78,099 (EXACT)
   - COGS = ₹1,50,000 (EXACT)
   ...
```

### 2. "DO NOT CALCULATE" Rule
```javascript
2. NEVER CALCULATE - ONLY READ
   - DO NOT add, subtract, multiply, or divide
   - DO NOT estimate or approximate
   - DO NOT use formulas
   - ONLY copy the exact numbers above
```

### 3. Copy-Only Instructions
```javascript
3. ANSWER FORMAT:
   Q: "What's my gross profit?"
   A: "Gross profit is ₹3,28,686" (copy from above)
   
   Q: "What's my revenue?"
   A: "₹4,78,686 from 2,918 orders"
```

### 4. Added Logging
Now logs what data is sent to AI:
```javascript
console.log('📊 Data sent to AI:', {
  revenue: 478686.3,
  grossProfit: 328686.3,
  netProfit: 178099,
  ...
});
```
