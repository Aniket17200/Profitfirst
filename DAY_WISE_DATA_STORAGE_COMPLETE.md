## How AI Uses This Data

### User Query: "What was the profit on 2 October?"

**Step 1: Date Detection**
```
Query: "What was the profit on 2 October?"
↓
Date Parser: Detects "2 October" → "2023-10-02"
```

**Step 2: Pinecone Query**
```
Enhanced AI queries Pinecone:
Filter: {
  userId: "user123",
  type: "daily_metrics",
  date: "2023-10-02"
}
↓
Pinecone returns: 1 record with exact data for Oct 2
```

**Step 3: AI Response**
```
AI reads metadata:
- netProfit: 12450
- revenue: 45000
- orders: 150

AI responds:
"On October 2, your net profit was ₹12,450 from ₹45,000 revenue and 150 orders."
```

## Complete Data Flow

### 1. Data Collection (Sync Script)

```javascript
// For each day in last 30 days
for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
  const date = "2023-10-02"; // Example
  
  // Fetch from APIs
  const shopifyOrders = await fetchShopifyOrders(date);
  const metaAds = await fetchMetaAds(date);
  const shiprocketShipments = await fetchShiprocket(date);
  
  // Calculate metrics
  const dayData = {
    date: "2023-10-02",
    revenue: calculateRevenue(shopifyOrders),
    orders: shopifyOrders.length,
    cogs: calculateCOGS(shopifyOrders, productCosts),
    adSpend: metaAds.spend,
    roas: revenue / adSpend,
    shipments: shiprocketShipments.length,
    delivered: shiprocketShipments.filter(s => s.status === 'delivered').length,
    // ... more metrics
  };
  
  // Store in Pinecone
  await pineconeDataSync.storeDailyData(userId, [dayData], summary);
}
```

### 2. Data Storage (Pinecone)

```
Day 1: Oct 1 → Stored with all metrics
Day 2: Oct 2 → Stored with all metrics
Day 3: Oct 3 → Stored with all metrics
...
Day 30: Oct 30 → Stored with all metrics

Each day is a separate record with:
- Unique ID
- Exact date
- All metrics
- Searchable metadata
```

### 3. Data Retrieval (AI Query)

```javascript
// User asks about specific date
const results = await pineconeDataSync.queryData(
  userId,
  "data for 2023-10-02",
  5,
  {
    type: "daily_metrics",
    date: "2023-10-02"
  }
);

// Returns exact data for that day
// AI uses this to generate response
```
