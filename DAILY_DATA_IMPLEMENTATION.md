## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Sync Data

Run this to fetch and store daily data:

```bash
npm run pinecone:sync
```

**What happens:**
- Fetches last 7 days (daily data)
- Fetches last 30 days (daily data + summary)
- Fetches last 60 days (summary only)
- Fetches last 90 days (summary only)

**Expected output:**
```
📅 Syncing Last 7 Days...
   📊 Fetching daily data for 7 days...
   ✅ Fetched 7 daily records
   ✅ Synced Last 7 Days: 8 records
      Daily records: 7
      Revenue: ₹1,05,000
      Orders: 350
      ROAS: 7.75x

📅 Syncing Last 30 Days...
   📊 Fetching daily data for 30 days...
   ✅ Fetched 30 daily records
   ✅ Synced Last 30 Days: 31 records
      Daily records: 30
      Revenue: ₹4,78,863
      Orders: 2,918
      ROAS: 7.78x
```

### Step 2: Test It

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat/enhanced/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What was my ROAS on October 15?"}'
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "reply": "On October 15, your ROAS was 7.8x with ₹15,000 revenue from 50 orders. Your ad spend was ₹1,923, generating strong returns.",
  "dataPoints": 3
}
```

## 🎨 Auto-Sync

Data syncs automatically when:

1. **User initializes chat** - Syncs all periods
2. **Dashboard loads** - Background sync (optional)
3. **Manual trigger** - Via API endpoint

### Cooldown System

- ✅ 5-minute cooldown between syncs
- ✅ Prevents excessive API calls
- ✅ Can force sync if needed

```javascript
// Check sync status
const status = autoSyncPinecone.getSyncStatus(userId);
console.log(status);
// {
//   inProgress: false,
//   lastSync: "2024-10-16T10:30:00Z",
//   needsSync: false,
//   cooldownRemaining: 180000 // 3 minutes
// }
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Run sync daily** - Set up cron job for fresh data
2. **Monitor API calls** - Daily data fetching uses more API calls
3. **Cache results** - Cache frequent queries for speed
4. **Use hybrid approach** - Daily for recent, summaries for old
5. **Test edge cases** - Try different date formats

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No daily data found"

**Solution:** Run sync again
```bash
npm run pinecone:sync
```

### Issue: "Sync takes too long"

**Solution:** Reduce daily data period
```javascript
// In autoSyncPinecone.js
if (period.days <= 7) { // Only last 7 days instead of 30
  // Fetch daily data
}
```

### Issue: "Rate limit errors"

**Solution:** Increase delays
```javascript
// In autoSyncPinecone.js
if (i % 5 === 0 && i > 0) {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // 1 second
}
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Pinecone Dashboard

1. Go to https://app.pinecone.io
2. Select index: `profitfirst-analytics`
3. Check vector count (should increase after sync)
4. View recent queries

### Check Logs

Look for:
```
✅ Fetched 30 daily records
✅ Synced Last 30 Days: 31 records
   Daily records: 30
```
